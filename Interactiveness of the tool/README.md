# Overview

To enhance the usability of the monitoring tool, an interactive curses-based interface has been implemented using Python. This interface provides a menu-driven experience, allowing users to execute monitoring tasks, view logs, and generate reports directly within a terminal.

### Features

User-Friendly Navigation: Navigate options using arrow keys and select with the Enter key.
Dynamic Actions: Execute monitoring tasks or view logs directly from the interface.
Real-Time Interaction: Seamlessly integrates with the monitoring script for a smooth experience.

### Requirements

#### Python 3:

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
#### Curses Module:

This comes pre-installed with Python.
To install Python 3 on your system, use:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3

#### Execute the interface script:

python3 monitor_ui.py
